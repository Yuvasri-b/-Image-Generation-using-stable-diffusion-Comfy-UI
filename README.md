 Image Generation using stable diffusion & Comfy UI - Workflow 

Data Flow: The workflow starts with input data, often a text prompt. This data flows through the connected nodes.
Node Execution: Each node receives input data, processes it according to its function and parameters, and then outputs the processed data.
Sequential Processing: The nodes are executed in the order defined by the connections. The output of one node becomes the input for the next.
Image Generation: The KSampler node is the central part of the workflow. It uses the encoded text prompt, along with other parameters and the loaded model, to generate the image.
Output: The final node in the workflow, usually the "Save Image" node, saves the generated image to a file.
